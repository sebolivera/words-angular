# Words

## Description

"Words" is an unfinished game app project I created to (re)teach myself some angular after not using it for years. The features are really restricted at the moment, but I will gradually implement more as I go.

**Note**: I know that Angular is a poor choice of language to build a game, but I don't plan on releasing this to any particular platform, and as of right now it's mostly just a terrible 2D walking simulator in a contained grid.

## Setup (for browser display)

- Install ionic with `npm install -g @ionic-cli` (you might need to use `sudo`, depending on your config)
- Run `npm install` at the root of the project
- Run `ionic serve` to start the app in browser

## How to play

- Move the character using the arrow keys
- Push the letters around to form words
- (Some) coherent words will make up objects that you can use
- Some objects can't be pushed
- Some objects will kill you
- Press 'u' to undo
- Press 'r' to restart the level
